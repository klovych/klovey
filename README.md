I'm too lazy to develop anything, so during work hours  
I write this readme on github, thinking I'm the coolest developer on earth.  
At the same time I'm thinking about how nice it would be to take this cute girl  
out for a walk or something.  
_(i did it.)_

If you still think I'm a good developer,  
you've probably met a very arrogant me on one of the discord servers,  
furiously trying to prove a completely unviable theory or some other unnecessary bullshit.

Dude, do you really think I'm going to brag about my code?
